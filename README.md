**************************
RED BADGE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT
**************************
Using the Yelp API, build an angular application that allows a user to find a random restaurant based on their location and price point. The restaurant that is returned must be opened at the time of the search, if not the user should not see it.
The restaurant details that is shown in the app should be:
image
rating (as stars)
Restaurant name 
Address
phone number 
If it delivers or not
If time add in a google map of the location 
NOTE :: You will need both a client, AND a server for this to work all the way. Your client will make a request to your server, and the server will make a request to the Yelp API. The request will come back to the server, and your server will send it back to the client.
Look into the Axios NPM package
